# Composer
This project creates computer-generated music from a user-entered list of existing pieces of music. Supported input and output file types include MIDI and MusicXML. The program is written in Python, and uses the Music21 package (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/music21) for reading and writing MIDI and MusicXML files.

This is an ongoing project that's not yet finished. Currently, the algorithm picks out different length parts of the instrument tracks, and composes music by mixing and modifying them. Future features will include modifying the notes and rhythms of the parts, as well as making sure the new composition sounds more fluid and less random.
